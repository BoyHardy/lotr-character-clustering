# The Lord of the Rings Films: Main Characters

This starts as all good stories do - in the pub.

A fire crackled gently in the corner, the chairs soft, the room was warm and inviting. One could confuse it for a hobbit hole but it was, in fact, just a nice pub! 

Two beers sat on the table (next to a few empty glasses) and the nerdy conversation about the Lord of the Ring cinematic trilogy flowed. 


"Will we ever get a trilogy as good again?" <br>
"If you could be any character, who would you be and why?" <br>
"Were they a main character" <br>
"Yea but they're a bad guy..." <br>
"Yea they're a massive part, but only the first film.."

It got me wondering... let's remove the cloud of personal opinion. Can a data science project objectively group the characters in a way that makes sense and answers our question: 
### Who are the main characters in The Lord of the Rings films?
